# Soulary
This is mod for minecraft, which is about souls and their feelings.

## Idea
When you playing minecraft, you're discovering a big world with many structures, mechanics and mobs.
Mobs. They are like dumb dummies, which attacking you, when you near them, or just walking and waiting, when you will kill them.
That's boring. You don't feel, what they're living, they're like a pig in a slaughterhouse, another resource source for your ambitions.
This mod should fix this.
Every living entity right now have soul. And they can feel. They can hate you, or can be friends with you.
You can disappoint them, or they can become attached to you. So, like in real life.
But, you have souls, so that means you have magic!
You (and any other living entity) can release your will and feels in the form of spells!
Most part of mod was inspired and made with backed on plutchiks wheel of emotions. (https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00357-019-9307-0/MediaObjects/357_2019_9307_Fig1_HTML.png)
